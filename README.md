# Implementation of TASE-RK-methods
TASE-RK-methods [Calvo, Montijano, Rández, “A note on the stability of time-accurate and highly-stable explicit operators for stiff differential equations”, J. Comput. Phys. 436 (2021), 110316] implemented in Matlab.
The implementation allows two options:
- update the Jacobian at each step;
- fix a constant approximation of the Jacobian for all the time integration.
